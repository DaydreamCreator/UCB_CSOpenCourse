[ Abstraction ]

-> Complexity and Abstraction
  Programming is easy, so long as your programs are small.
    - Complexity is our enemy.
    - Abstraction is the key to conquering complexity.

-> Abstraction:
  [Detail Removel]: hide unnecessary detail from users
  E.g., vehicle pedal: right pedal for accelerate, left pedal for decelerate
        even as underlying technology has changed, this abstraction has not.
        
  [Detail Removel]: hide unnecessary detail from other designers
  that is, Nice to be able to think of a system as a hierarchy of well defined “chunks” with precise functionality.
          [ Separation of Concerns / SoC ]
 
  [Generalization]: avoid unnecessary repetitive work

  Identifying the right abstraction that you need to solve your problem.
