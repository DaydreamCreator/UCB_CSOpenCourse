The Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE)
- Given variables y and x:
    y = x // copies all the bits from x into y

[ Reference Type ]
There are 8 primitive types in Java: 
  - byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

Everything else, including arrays, is a [ reference type ].

The variable name of a new object is a 64-bit pointer to the address of new object, if not assigned, all zeros with new object as "null".

[ Parameter Passing ]
Passing parameters obeys the same rule as the GRoE: Simply copy the bits to the new scope.
( Pass by value )
